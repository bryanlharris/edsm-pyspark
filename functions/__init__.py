"""Expose functional submodules.

Callers should reference functions using fully qualified module paths,
for example ``functions.read.stream_read_files``. Importing these
submodules here allows :func:`importlib.import_module` to resolve modules
such as ``functions.read`` while avoiding re-exporting function names at the
package level.
